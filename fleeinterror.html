	<p>",Forget everything you have and everything you knew, For no matter how much you struggle nothing will be renewed
	You've strayed to far into the devil's den, and now you face a wrath with no repent. Pray all you want plead all you like
	but your god isn't here and will not save your life. You run headlong into the brush and hope you may salvage a little luck,
	yet all is lost and within hours you are stuck in the endless maze of woods. The beast approachs, and before you can appreciate
	surviving like roaches your life comes to a bloody end. The beast roars alas and casts your head to the masses of scavengers in
	his wake. Then rips out your soul, and swallows it whole. Before mounting your skull on a stake."</p>
