	<p>",You flee the hollow, regretting to truly follow and heed the advise of many, but before you are ready you turn
	around and realize that you aren't steady for a trail there isn't any. You dart left and you dash right in a hurry to
	leave your fears behind, yet before you can cry a screech fills the night and approaches your blindside. So little did
	you spy a pair of yellow eyes, as talons reach down from the skies. too late are you now, for the owl hoots loud eating
	your eyes without spite. But now you will die before the moon rise blind and afraid of the night."</p>
