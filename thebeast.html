	<p>The Beast:", Begone you helpless lassy or lad, for this is not your land. No man woman or child shall ever trespass where I stand.
		I am the king of this woodland world from which I reign supreme, your soul shall now be judged as I see fit for a fate that
		I shall deam. But right now the choice is yours to consider the value of your life. Shall you face a god in battle and test your 
		might or shall I begin your hunt as you scream into the night. For I am your greatest fears and by far your worst frights,
		no matter how far you run you'll always be within my sight. The hour of Judgement is upon us now its time to make your choice,
		will you take a gamble and say your last words, or retreat and save your voice."</p>
