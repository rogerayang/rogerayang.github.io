		<p>Eagle:",From where do you come? to where do you go? to what do you seek? From the forest around you so,
			Do you know? If what you seek is unknown, then take the path that few walk and fewer own.
			If what you seek is clear or lucid, then seek the giant who sleeps beneath the spruces".</p>
		<img src="https://rogerayang.github.io/netart/stag.jpg"/>
		<p>Stag:",So you choose the road that is already paved, the road that few ever stray. Relieveing a burden
			that weights heavy, upon feet that carry you firm and steady. The path of least resistance snakes on that way,
			to the lair of a creature who slithers all day."</p>
		<img src="https://rogerayang.github.io/netart/fox.jpg"/>
		<p>Fox:",Hello there stranger, do you sense the danger? For this road is rarely travelled, and visitors end up baffled.
			Because they can not see what does not please and can not hear what they do not fear. To clear what cursees your 
			understanding of what you seek, seek out the Ursus and be wary when you speak."</p>
		<img src="https://rogerayang.github.io/netart/bear.jpg"/>
		<p>Bear:",Welcome to my domain, where the spruce trees reign. So what can I do for you today, be careful what you wish for
			or say, for one wrong turn can be your grave. If you're feeling bold or knightly in a way, meet with the lord of the
			night at the hollow where he stays. If you're feeling cautious or not very brave, counsel with the raven who live down
			that way."</p>
		<img src="https://rogerayang.github.io/netart/spider.jpg"/>
		<p>Spider:",Do you fear what you can't see? Do you fear what you don't know? Do you fear what you can see, yet can not understand
			though? Take heed to this advise, for it may help save your life. Step into the darkness if you are ready, towards the eyes
			that see so many or step towards the dappled spruces were a wise giant stays elusive".</p>
		<img src="https://rogerayang.github.io/netart/serpent.jpg"/>
		<p>Serpent:",I see the stag has sent you my way, to guide you through this treacherous maze. The pathway is narrow and the woods
			are tight, for the creatures you shall come across may stay out of sight. For what lives beyond my lair in the night, may take
			many forms yet has terrifying might. Take the chance if you choose, prepare your last words if you lose. May you hope that you
			aren't rushing too soon, into a marked grave of certain doom."</p>
		<img src="https://rogerayang.github.io/netart/owl.jpg"/>
		<p>Owl:",Bravo brave traveller I commend you I do, for you've entered a place where the unprepared are doomed. Let bravery
			not become arrogrance, let confidence not become your fool; for a wrongly directed wayward glance, will be the end
			if you duel."</p>
		<img src="https://rogerayang.github.io/netart/raven.jpg"/>
		<p>Raven:",I see you seek my counsel come closely if you may, for the words that I speak to you now may change your very day.
			Your path has been safe so far and you may wish it stay that way, But an ancient being guards the forest exit and life
			is the toll one pays. To see the light at the end of path you must face him in the dark, and should you survive his first 
			attack he will make it even harsh. Do not take him lightly for if you do he'll take you as a fool, and garnish his trophy 
			tree with your soul and your body as his food."</p>
		<img src="https://rogerayang.github.io/netart/thebeast.jpg"/>
		The Beast:", Begone you helpless lassy or lad, for this is not your land. No man, woman or child shall ever trespass where I stand.
			I am the king of this woodland world from which I reign supreme, your soul shall now be judged as I see fit for a fate that
			I shall deam. But right now the choice is yours to consider the value of your life. Shall you face a god in battle and test your 
			might or shall I begin your hunt as you scream into the night. For I am your greatest fears and by far your worst frights,
			no matter how far you run you'll always be within my sight. The hour of Judgement is upon us its time to make your choice,
		will you take a gamble and say your last words, or retreat and save your voice."</p>
