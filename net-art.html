		<p>Eagle:",From where do you come? to where do you go? to what do you seek? From the for around you so,
			Do you know? If what you seek is unknown, then take the path that few walk and fewer own.
			If what you seek is clear or lucid, then seek the giant who sleeps beneath the spruces".</p>

		<p>Stag:",So you choose the road that is already paved, the road that few ever stray. Relieveing a burden
			that weights heavy, upon feet that carry you firm and steady. The path of least resistance snakes on that way,
			to the lair of a creature who slithers all day."</p>

		<p>Fox:",Hello there stranger, do you sense the danger? For this road is rarely travelled, and visitors end up baffled
			because they can not see what does not please and can not hear what they do not fear. To clear what cursees your 
			understanding of what you seek, seek out the Ursus and be wary when you speak."</p>

		<p>Bear:",Welcome to my domain, where the spruce trees reign. So what can I do for you today, be careful what you wish for
			or say, for one wrong turn can be your grave. If you're feeling bold or knightly in a way, meet with the lord of the
			night at the hollow where he stays. If you're feeling cautious or not very brave, counsel with the raven who live down
			that way."</p>
