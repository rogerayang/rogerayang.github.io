	<p>Raven:",I see you seek my counsel come closely if you may, for the words that I speak to you now may change your very day.
		Your path has been safe so far and you may wish it stay that way, But an ancient being guards the forest exit and life
		is the toll one pays. To see the light at the end of path you must face him in the dark, and should you survive his first 
		attack he will make it even harsh. Do not take him lightly for if you do he'll take you as a fool, and garnish his trophy 
		tree with your soul and your body as his food."</p>
