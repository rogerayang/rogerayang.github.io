	<p>Be brave if you would, be brave if you might. But beware the unknown, for its full of fright. No matter how you 
	feel or sweat in the slightest. To reveal the path you must be frightless. For could've should've would've you may
	ask, but to reach your destination you must step. . .</p>

	<p>You stand at the edge of the woods as told, and see a sign wedged between two trees that is old. You pull and
	tug until the sign gives way, and on it you see directions as bold as they are paved. Four seperate roads split four
	seperate ways, into the woods where an odd mist lays. You know you must and trust in yourself you do, to do the best 
	you can to choose.</p>
