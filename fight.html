	<p>",You stand your ground and prepare your first round with a beast who's twice as tall, You take a branch from a
	tree, and break it over your knee as you set your battle stance. Preparing to lash out at the fangs of a god, who 
	refused to retract this bout. As you brawl and take hits but refuse to quit the sky darkens above, the rain falls 
	swiftly and just as quickly your hope takes flight like a dove. For a bright white light streaks in the sky above
	all else and spark an idea in your head, and as you battle on the brute judges wrong and strikes a boulder instead.
	you take your chance and fly like a lance to a clearing just ahead, where you make a dive beneath the cracked hide 
	where a dead tree used to stand. The beast is upon you fast and he prepares the final blow, But before he attacks
	the sky rumbles and cracks as a lightning bolt strikes his soul. No sooner then that it ends alas as his body withers
	to ash, and all that is left of the beast's last breath is the gaping wounds on your back. But victorious you are,
	for none have gotten so far and defeat the beast before. So on you go a little wiser and older to claim your well
	deserved rest, and hope the times you spent in life will truly be your best."</p>
